Lots of good stuff to say about this one, Mike!  I like the "about" message
that you display when the label is clicked.  I like that you have error 
handling, and display a different message when the input box is empty.  I
like that you specify a title for your message boxes.

About the only thing I'd suggest is that you might want to use Trim() on
the value of the TextBox, and that you might want to compare against
String.Empty instead of "".  You probably still want to display the error
message if someone enters white space in the TextBox.
