Hah!  Congratulations -- you definitely made me laugh with this one.
Checkbox #2...*shudder*  Although, I have to say, you really missed an
opportunity.  Instead of opening http://www.youtube.com/, Checkbox #4 
should have opened http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0

Just sayin'.

Also, I like the PictureBox control.  Not one I was familiar with before
this.
