Great work, Amy!  I'm pleased to see that you got the extra credit
done, as well as the base assignment.

The use of "\r\n" to add a newline to your message box works fine,
but it's not as readable, or as reliable, as another option -- 
the Environment.NewLine constant.  Environment.NewLine is always set 
to whatever will create a carriage return and line feed (the standard 
"new line" behavior) in the environment where the code is executing.  
You use it like this:

            MessageBox.Show("This is what you typed:" +
                Environment.NewLine +
                textBox1.Text);
