Very nice.  Clearly, I am now obligated to grant you an A+ in the class. :-)

I have one question -- the icons for the first name and last name fields 
are displaying on my computer as a blue question-mark with a small gray
silhouette of a person next to it.  Is this how they display on your
computer, or is this an error due to an unavailable image resource?

If it's the latter, I'd like to work with you before class on 
Thursday to see if we can figure out why your image resource files
didn't check in with the rest of your code.
