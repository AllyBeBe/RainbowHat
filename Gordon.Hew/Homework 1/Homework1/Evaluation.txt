Nicely done.  I notice that you used an instance variable (InputText), 
or (as C# would describe it) a "field", which you update whenever the 
text box's contents change.  You could also simply have accessed
textBox1.Text on line 24, but I'm guessing you wanted to explore
features of the language more than you wanted to optimize your code.  :-)
