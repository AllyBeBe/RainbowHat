Excellent work!  I certainly wasn't expecting the kaleidoscope of rapidly
whirling images at the end there...very amusing.

I'm also very impressed by your use of an array of strings to hold
the messages, and I think that the use of a NumericUpDown control to
hold the value is very clever.  And, of course, actually adding an 
image resource to your app, loading it from the file system with
System.Drawing.Image.FromFile(), closing the form at the end, etc.  Just a
very good app overall.

I do have a few minor suggestions:

1) You should probably move the UpdateComponent() method into Form1.cs, as
that's the more typical place for business logic like that.  The Designer
file is usually left for the design tool to control.

2) You may want to use an integer instance field instead of the
NumericUpDown control.  I know that we hadn't covered instance fields
by Homework 2, but now that we've started looking at them, you might want
to go back and modify your Homework 2 to use one.

3) Both "filepath" and "messages" remain the same, no matter how many 
times UpdateComponent() is called.  Thus, they should probably be created
as "private static readonly" fields, instead of as local variables in 
UpdateComponent().

"private" means "only instances of this class can see this variable."

"static" means "there is only one copy of this variable for the whole
class, and it can be accessed by any instance of the class."

"readonly" means "this variable can't be re-assigned after it has had its
value set the first time."

If you made the above changes, Form1.cs would look something like:

    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private static readonly string filepath = "../../Properties/light_explosion.gif";
        private static readonly string[] messages = new string[] 
        { 
			"Huh? " + Environment.NewLine + "I told you not to click it! " + Environment.NewLine + "Don't Click it AGAIN!",
            "Did you do that by accident?" + Environment.NewLine + "No more!",
            "Uh Oh. Most people will try their best so you may have a computer glitch! " + Environment.NewLine + "Better not click again or your computer might crash!",
            "Now you've done it!" + Environment.NewLine + "Your computer is wacking out!"
        };

		private int messageIndex;
		
		private void UpdateComponent()
        {
            if (messageIndex < messages.Length)
            {
                this.MakeMeLaugh.Text = messages[messageIndex];
            }
            messageIndex = messageIndex + 1;

            if (messageIndex == messages.Length)
            {
                this.MakeMeLaugh.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(200,40);
                this.MakeMeLaugh.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(50,200);
                this.pictureBox1.Visible = true;
                this.pictureBox1.Image =  System.Drawing.Image.FromFile(filepath);
            }
            else if (messageIndex > messages.Length)
            {
                Form1.ActiveForm.Close();
            }
		}

		// and so on...
