Very nice work, Tiina!  I particularly like that you have two different
controls (the "Homework #10 reworded" button and the top label) that call
the same event handler method.  That's tricky, and a great way to 
demonstrate how code can be re-used by calling a method from different
places.  

I also really like the link on educational philosophy.  I recommend it
to everyone in the class.
