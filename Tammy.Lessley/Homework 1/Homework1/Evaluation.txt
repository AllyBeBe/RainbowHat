Nice work.  I like that you added a separate label to display the 
greeting, rather than just popping it up in a MessageBox.Show().

There are a few pieces of "dead code" in your application that you might
want to clean up.  I notice that the textBox1_TextChanged_1() method doesn't
actually do anything, and that the textBox1_TextChanged() method, which does
do something, is only being called by Form1's TextChanged event, not by 
txtInput's TextChanged event.  These don't do any harm to the function of
the code, but they do make it harder to understand what the code is doing.
